# Landscape-Evolution-Model
This Repository includes a landscape evolution model which can be used at catchment and laboratory scales. In the following, the structure of the attached folders is described.

folder "LEM_uniformD":

The model includes three sub-folders: input, model, results. The input folder contains the measured Digital Elevation Models that are used for model calibration and as the initial conditions.
1) input: 
This folder includes the experimental data of a flume study. They can easily be changed to another geomorphological data for laboratory and field scales. The files "00h00_8mm.dat" to 16h00min_8mm.dat" show the elevation field (z) of the flume

The details of the experiment are described at:
Cheraghi, M., Rinaldo, A., Sander, G. C., Perona, P., & Barry, D. A. (2018). Catchment drainage network scaling laws found experimentally in over-land flow morphologies. Geophysical Research Letters, 45, 9614â€“9622. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078351

2)model:
This folder includes the codes. All classes and functions are written in "header.h" file.  





3) results.
